**SymWiki** is a personal Wiki application for Symbian S60 devices. It supports a subset of emacs-wiki syntax.

It is written in Python for S60, so it runs on every platform where Pys60 runs.

# Download & Installation #

**Requirements:** First you must install [Pys60](http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/pythonfors60/) and [appuifw2](http://code.google.com/p/appuifw2/) to your device.

**For S60 3rd Ed. devices:** download sis-package, put in to your phone and install to the same disk where your Python installed. You will find new icon **SymWiki** in the applications menu.

**For other S60 devices:** download zip-archive, put it to your device and unpack to the `\Python` folder on the same disk where your Python installed. Launch Python shell, press **Run script** and select `symwiki.py` from the list.
